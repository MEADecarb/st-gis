    **Purpose:**
    The Vector Data Visualization page allows users to upload, select, and explore various vector data formats such as CSV, XLSX, ZIP, and GEOJSON. This page is ideal for visualizing geospatial data points, lines, and polygons on an interactive map.

    **Key Features:**
    - **Upload Files**: Users can upload their own files in supported formats (CSV, XLSX, ZIP, GEOJSON).
    - **Select Pre-uploaded Files**: Users can choose from a set of pre-uploaded files available via a dropdown menu.
    - **View Interactive Map**: The map updates automatically to display data from the selected or uploaded files.
    - **Data Table**: The data associated with the map is displayed in a table below the map for easy viewing and analysis.

st.markdown("### Data Manipulation üìä")

st.write(
    """
    **Purpose:**
    The Data Manipulation page provides users with tools to perform detailed analysis and manipulation of their data. This page is perfect for users who need to filter, transform, and export data for further analysis.

    **Key Features:**
    - **Upload and Select Files**: Similar to the Vector Data Visualization page, users can upload their own files or select from pre-uploaded options.
    - **Advanced Filtering**: Users can apply complex filters to the data to isolate specific subsets based on custom criteria.
    - **Interactive Map and Data Table**: The map and data table are dynamically linked, allowing users to see the impact of their filters in real-time.
    - **Download Filtered Data**: After manipulating the data, users can download the filtered dataset as a CSV file.
